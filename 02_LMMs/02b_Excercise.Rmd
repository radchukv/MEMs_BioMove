# Small exercise for you
Please use `lme4` package and the data we used in the last practical session (on the relation between phenology and temperature across species) to fit mixed-effect models with:      
- random intercept, and          
- random slope.      
Produce the predictions with the fitted models and plot them.    

Compare the obtained parameter estimates with those we obtained when using `spaMM` package.

_Some help:_     
- if you have difficulties reading in the data yourself, please see the .Rmd file from the practical session in which we were loading in the data and doing a bit of data preparation.        
- for the syntax of mixed-effects models with `lme4` see the lecture material.

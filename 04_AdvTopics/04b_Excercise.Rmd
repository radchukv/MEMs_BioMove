# Small exercise for you
We encountered an issue about convergence when trying to fit the model without a quadratic effect of time since the begin of hibernation: "Warning in fitTMB(TMBStruc): Model convergence problem; singular convergence". Try to find the way to fit the model without any convergence issues.
Compare the output of this model with the one we fitted during the lecture.


_Some help:_     
- Think what are the ways to deal with convergence issues.    
- Some more help here: [glmmTMB_troubleshooting](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmmTMB/vignettes/troubleshooting.html )
